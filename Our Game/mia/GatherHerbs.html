    <p>Hoping that you will be able to gather herbs required for potions, you go to the fields. Unfortunately, a hurricane occurred the other day and you find that all the herbs has bitten the dust. Feeling disappointed, you go back to the guild to finally choose an quest. Which quest would you like to do?  Your options are: <a href="Dragon.html">Slay a Dragon</a> or <a href="Goblin.html">Defeat a Goblin</a></p>
